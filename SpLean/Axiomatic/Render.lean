/-! # Rendering graph-style `ZXDiagram`s

    The `MetaM` side of graph-style visualization: turning an `Expr` into
    `Html`. Kept apart from `Visualize.lean` (which is pure) so that
    `SpLean/Panel.lean` has one renderer per representation to dispatch
    between, mirroring `SpLean/Algebraic/Render.lean`.

    Both entry points here *evaluate* the term — `evalZXDiagram`, i.e.
    `Meta.evalExpr` — so they need it closed. That is the opposite of the
    algebraic side, which walks the `Expr` and can draw an open term. A
    `none` means "not this kind of expression at all"; a term of the right
    shape that cannot be evaluated throws, and the caller decides whether
    that is an error or simply nothing to draw. -/
