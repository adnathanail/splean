# SpLean.Algebraic

A free-algebra ZX representation (`ZX n m`, indexed by input/output arity) with
a denotational interpretation into complex matrices over Mathlib. Lives
*alongside* the graph-style `ZXDiagram`. There is a one-way `ZX → ZXDiagram`
translation for **rendering only** (`Visualize.lean` — see below); the
`Rules/*` rewrite machinery still operates on `ZXDiagram` directly.

## Why this module exists

`SpLean/Axioms.lean` defines `≈z` as syntactic equality after compaction,
which is too weak to prove rewrite-rule soundness — every rewrite rule in
`SpLean/Rules/` is therefore axiomatised. This module gives a *semantic*
equivalence (`≃ZX` = matrix equality) so rewrite rules can be proven outright.
`Z_spiderFusion` in `SpiderFusion.lean` is the first such proof; its axiom
audit is `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]` only.

## Conventions

- **Composition order**: `compose a b` reads "first `a`, then `b`", so
  `⟦a ⨾ b⟧ = ⟦b⟧ * ⟦a⟧` (matrices act right-to-left).
- **Index convention**: `Matrix (Fin (2^m)) (Fin (2^n)) ℂ` — rows are outputs,
  columns are inputs. All-zeros basis vector at index `0`, all-ones at `2^k - 1`.
- **`Z_spiderMatrix` is a *sum* of two indicators, not nested `if`s.** Required
  for the `n = m = 0` corner case where both indices collide at `0` (a 0-leg
  spider is the scalar `1 + e^{iφ}`, not `1`).
- **`Phase.den : ℕ+`**, so `den = 0` is ruled out at the type level.
  `phaseToComplex_add` and the spider-fusion theorems carry no `den ≠ 0`
  hypothesis.

## Current placeholder semantics (deliberate, not `sorry`)

`ZX.sem` returns `0` for `hadamard`, `spider .X _ _ _`, and `stack _ _`. The
Z-spider-fusion proof never pattern-matches these branches, so they don't
affect its correctness — but **any new theorem touching H, X-spiders, or
tensor products needs real semantics first**:

- `stack`: Kronecker product with `Fin (2^(n+p)) ≃ Fin (2^n) × Fin (2^p)`
  reindexing (via `finProdFinEquiv` and `Nat.pow_add`).
- `spider .X`: Hadamard sandwich of the Z-spider — depends on `stack` for
  `H^⊗n`.
- `hadamard`: `![![1, 1], ![1, -1]] / √2`.

## Proof tactics that worked here

- For `Fin.sum_univ_two` over `Fin (2^1)`: use `show (∑ s : Fin 2, …)` to coerce
  the index type — the lemma won't unify against `Fin (2^1)` directly even
  though they're defeq.
- Collapsing `(if h₁ then a else 0) * (if h₂ then b else 0)` to a single
  AND-indicator: `simp only [mul_ite, ite_mul, mul_one, mul_zero, zero_mul, ← ite_and]`.
  Note `simp` happens to apply `mul_ite` first, which controls which condition
  ends up "outside" in the resulting AND.

## Visualization (`Visualize.lean`)

`ZX.toHtml` renders an algebraic term in the existing `ZXWidget`. The walker
threads a private `Frag` (diagram + open `left`/`right` port-id lists +
`(width, height, pos, boxes)`) through the constructors. Every node carries an
algebraic-grid `(col, qubit)` position emitted alongside the JSON, so the
widget skips its BFS layout and the visual reflects the term's structure.
Each `stack`/`compose` subtree also records a `BoxRecord` covering its
extent; the widget draws translucent rectangles behind the diagram so the
algebraic nesting is visible at a glance.

Per-constructor layout:

- `wire` → one `.wire` node at `(0, 0)`, rendered by the widget as a small
  black dot (radius `0.2 * node_size`). Wires stay as real nodes rather than
  being spliced out. Width 1, height 1.
- `hadamard` → one `.hadamard` node at `(0, 0)`. Width 1, height 1.
- `spider c n m φ` → one node at `(0, 0)` (its top input row); `left = replicate n id`,
  `right = replicate m id`. Width 1, height `max n m`.
- `stack a b` → concatenate; shift `b`'s qubits by `a.height`.
  Width `max a.width b.width`, height `a.height + b.height`.
- `compose a b` → connect `a.right` to `b.left` and shift `b`'s cols by `a.width`.
  Width `a.width + b.width`, height `max a.height b.height`.

`stack` and `compose` each emit a `BoxRecord {kind, nodeIds}` listing the ids
of every node in their subtree (with appropriate shifts on `compose`/`stack`).
Leaves emit no box. Pixel bounds are computed in `zxViewer.js` from each
node's live `.x/.y`, so boxes follow drags and don't extend past visible
nodes (which would otherwise happen on subtrees containing spliced wires).
The JSON emitter drops boxes whose `nodeIds` are all `none` after splicing.

Boundary `.input`/`.output` nodes are added **only** at the top level by
`ZX.toPositionedDiagram`, at `col = -1, qubit = ioId` (inputs) and
`col = width, qubit = ioId` (outputs). Internal fragments stay arity-pure
during recursion.

The JSON shape extends `ZXDiagram.toJson` with `col` (Int) and `qubit` (Nat)
fields per node, plus a top-level `boxes` array of `{kind, nodeIds}` records.
`zxRender.ts` honours the positions (skipping `autoLayout` whenever any node
has `col` set) and forwards boxes unchanged, sorted largest-id-count first
so outer paints behind inner. `zxViewer.js` accepts the box list as an extra
parameter to `showGraph`, renders them as the first `<g class="boxes">` child
of the SVG (with `pointer-events: none` so the brush layer still works), and
recomputes their bounds in `update_boxes()` after every drag tick. The
widget's `auto_hbox` flag is turned off in the positioned case, so hadamards'
supplied positions aren't overwritten by neighbour-barycentre repositioning.

`ZX.toZXDiagram` (used by callers that just need the graph) delegates to
`ZX.toPositionedDiagram` and discards the position list. Rendering-only —
there is no proof that the lowering preserves semantics (would need a
`ZXDiagram` denotation, which doesn't exist yet).
