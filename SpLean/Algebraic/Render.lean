/-! # Rendering algebraic `ZX n m` terms

    The `MetaM` side of algebraic visualization: turning a `ZX n m` `Expr`
    into `Html`. Kept apart from `Visualize.lean` (which is pure) so that
    the `#zx` command in `SpLean/Panel.lean` can draw algebraic terms.

    The term is walked at the `Expr` level rather than evaluated, because a
    `ZX n m` need not be closed: `abbrev f (α : AlgPhase) : ZX 0 0` is a
    perfectly good diagram whose phase is a *variable*. The walker binds any
    leading `∀`s, so `#zx f` draws the spider with `α` beside it, and only a
    phase it cannot evaluate is printed symbolically — a closed phase still
    goes through `AlgPhase.format`, exactly as a closed term's would. -/

/-- The text to draw for a phase argument. A closed phase is evaluated and

    `Meta.evalExpr` is why this is the one `unsafe` step of the walk, and why
    it is sealed behind an `opaque` here rather than at the top of it: the
    walker itself is ordinary `MetaM` code. -/

/-- Render an `Expr` as an algebraic ZX diagram, or `none` if it is not a
    `ZX n m` term (possibly under binders). The `#zx` command uses this to
    accept algebraic terms alongside graph-style `ZXDiagram`s.

    Leading `∀`s are instantiated with their own binders, so a diagram
    parameterized by a phase — `greenAlphaCircle : (α : AlgPhase) → ZX 0 0` —
    draws with `α` written beside the spider. -/

    not a `≈zx` application at all. A side that is not built from the `ZX`
    constructors throws, just as `zxTermHtml?` does — the caller decides
    whether that is an error or simply nothing to draw.

    Unlike the graph-style `≈z` case in `SpLean/Panel.lean`, neither side is
    evaluated: an algebraic goal in mid-proof is usually open (`α β : AlgPhase`
    in the context), and the walker draws those phases as themselves. -/
