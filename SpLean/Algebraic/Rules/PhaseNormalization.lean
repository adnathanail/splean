/-- Replace a spider's phase by its normal form in `[0, 2π)`.

The rule is `spider_congr` applied to `AlgPhase.expI_normalize`: normalizing
moves the representative but not the denotation, so the two spiders are equal
on the nose (`c = 1`), not merely proportional.

For a *closed* phase the normal form still has to be computed — `normalize
(2π)` is not syntactically `0` — and `decide` cannot do it, since `Int.floor`
on `ℚ` does not reduce in the kernel. Follow the rewrite with
`norm_num [AlgPhase.normalize, AlgPhase.red]`. -/
