/-- Algebraic phase: a rational multiple of π. The full `AddCommGroup` structure
    of `ℚ` is inherited automatically, so identities like
    `α + (-α) + α = α` close by `abel`, and any polynomial phase equality is
    discharged by `ring` / `field_simp` / `norm_num`.

    Semantic equality is mod-2π — captured by `phaseToComplex_periodic` rather
    than baked into definitional equality (which would force a quotient and
    make the type `noncomputable`, breaking widget rendering for concrete
    phases). -/

/-- Format an `AlgPhase` directly from its ℚ `num`/`den` (no mod-2π
    reduction — that's why we don't route through the graph-side
    `Phase.format`). ℚ is already in lowest terms by construction, so
    `phaseLit 2 4` formats as `π/2`; `phaseLit 9 2` formats as `9π/2`.
    Negative numerators carry the sign in `num`. -/
