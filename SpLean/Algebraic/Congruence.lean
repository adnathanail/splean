/-- A spider's `≃ZX`-class is determined by `phaseToComplex` of its phase —
    i.e. equal phases (modulo `2π`) give equivalent spiders.

    For `c = .Z` this follows from `Z_spiderMatrix_congr_phase`. For `c = .X`,
    `ZX.sem` is currently the placeholder `0` so the lemma is trivial; it will
    need re-proving once X-spider semantics is implemented. -/
