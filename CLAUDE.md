## Project structure

- `SpLean/` — Lean 4 library, split into one folder per representation plus the little that is genuinely shared:
  - `Widget.lean` — the zxcc **wire format** (`SpLean.Wire`: `NodeKind`, `Node`, `Edge`, `BoxKind`, `Box`, `Diagram`, `toJson`) and the ProofWidgets `ZXWidget` that eats it. A pure data-transfer type: no `Phase`, no `SpiderColor`, phases already display strings.
  - `Panel.lean` — the InfoView panel widget, expression presenter, and `#zx` command. The one file that knows both representations, because `#zx` dispatches on which it was handed.
  - `Axiomatic/` — the graph-based approach: `ZXDiagram.lean` (`SpiderColor`, `Phase`, `Node`, `Edge`, `ZXDiagram` + graph ops), `Visualize.lean` (`ZXDiagram → Wire.Diagram`), `Axioms.lean` (`≈z`), `Tactics.lean` (the rewrite tactics), `Rules/`, `DerivedRules/`, `Examples.lean`.
  - `Algebraic/` — the arity-indexed `ZX n m` approach, with its own spider colour (`AlgSpColor`), phase type and renderer, plus the denotational semantics (`Semantics.lean`), the proportionality equivalence (`Equiv.lean`), the rules proved against it (`Rules/`), the `zx_rw` tactic (`Tactics.lean`) and a few named gates (`Gate.lean`); see `SpLean/Algebraic/CLAUDE.md`.
  - `Utils.lean` — generic `List`/`Except`/`Option` helpers. `All.lean` imports everything.

  **`Axiomatic/` and `Algebraic/` import nothing from each other** — check with `grep -rh "^import" SpLean/Algebraic/`. They meet at `SpLean.Wire` and at `Panel.lean`, and nowhere else. The spider colour is deliberately defined twice rather than shared — `SpiderColor` in `Axiomatic/`, `AlgSpColor` in `Algebraic/` — since two three-line types are cheaper than an arrow between the halves. They are named apart so neither has to be identified by its namespace.
  **This is not a strict rule, it's just nice to have for now**
- `zx_view_widget/` — TypeScript ProofWidgets widget (React, rollup). A thin shell that hands the Lean diagram JSON to the `<zx-diagram>` web component from [`@adnathanail/zxcc`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@adnathanail/zxcc), which does the layout and SVG rendering.
- `Main.lean` — Entry point with example diagrams shown in InfoView

## Build commands

```sh
lake build
```

The JS bundle is built by rollup and written to `.lake/build/js/`. zxcc is bundled at build time; there are no runtime network requests.

## Key conventions

- `ZXDiagram` uses `List (Option Node)` for nodes (list indices are node IDs) and `List Edge` for edges.
- Construct diagrams with `ZXDiagram.ofList` (list indices become IDs) or `ZXDiagram.addNode`/`ZXDiagram.addEdge`
- Look up nodes with `d.getNode? id`, not direct list indexing
- ZXDiagram nodes: `.input ioId`, `.output ioId`, `.spider color phase`, `.hadamard`, `.wire` where phase is a `Phase` (`num : Int`, `den : ℕ+`)
- Phases become display-ready strings *before* reaching the wire format, and the widget prints them verbatim. Each representation formats its own: `Phase.format` (`Axiomatic/Visualize.lean`, normalizes mod 2π) and `AlgPhase.format` (`Algebraic/AlgPhase/Display.lean`, deliberately does not). A symbolic phase is just the pretty-printed phase argument in the same field.
- JSON wire format: written down once, in `SpLean/Widget.lean`, as `Wire.Diagram.toJson`. `{"nodes": [...], "edges": [{"src", "tgt"}]}`, with each node carrying `id`/`type` and whichever of `color`/`phase`/`ioId`/`col`/`qubit` apply — an `Option` that is `none` is *omitted*, not sent as null. Algebraic terms fill in `col`/`qubit` (which makes zxcc skip its own layout) and add a top-level `boxes` array of `{kind, nodeIds}`. Changing what the wire looks like means changing that one file and the two lowerings into it.
- Layout and rendering both live in the separate [zxcc](https://github.com/adnathanail/zxcc) repo, not here — change them there and release a new version.
- Demo diagrams live in `SpLean.Examples` (`SpLean/Axiomatic/Examples.lean`), not the root namespace, so that `open SpLean` doesn't take names like `cnot` out of a user's hands. Keep new example data there.

## Rewrite tactics

The two representations rewrite by completely different mechanisms: `≈z` is decided by evaluating diagrams, `≈zx` by `grw` over a proved relation. Neither tactic works on the other's goals.

### Axiomatic (`≈z`)

`applyRewrite` in `SpLean/Axiomatic/Tactics.lean` reduces a rule application with `whnf`, which exposes the `Except.ok` head but leaves the diagram's fields unevaluated. It then evaluates that diagram with `evalZXDiagram` and reflects the value back into an `Expr` with `reflectDiagram`, so the goal holds a flat literal rather than an application tree that grows with each tactic line.

`reflectDiagram`/`reflectNode`/`reflectPhase` mirror the `Node` and `Phase` definitions by hand and must be updated alongside them — a new constructor or field will otherwise reflect wrongly or fail to compile. They are `MetaM` rather than a `ToExpr` instance because an `ℕ+` denominator needs `mkNumeral` to synthesize its `OfNat` instance; that synthesis is cached per distinct denominator, since repeating it per phase measurably slows elaboration.

### Algebraic (`≈zx`)

`zx_rw` in `SpLean/Algebraic/Tactics.lean` is `rw` for `≈zx` rules — `zx_rw [zSpider_fusion]`, `zx_rw [← zSpider_fusion]` to unfuse. It is a thin macro over Mathlib's `grw`, which generalises `rw` to any relation that is reflexive, transitive and has congruence lemmas; `≈zx` supplies all three (`ZX.Equiv.refl` is `@[refl]`, and `compose_congr`/`stack_congr` are tagged `@[gcongr]` in `Tactics.lean` rather than at their definitions, to keep the `grw` import out of `Equiv.lean`). The `@[gcongr]` tags are what let a rule fire *inside* a larger diagram rather than only at the top.

Each goal `grw` leaves then gets a `zx_phase` pass, which normalises the phase arithmetic a rewrite produces — fusion outputs `α + β`, so `π/4 ≫ π/4` lands as `π/4 + π/4` where the goal says `π/2`. `zx_phase` pushes the `AlgPhase`s together with `← AlgPhase.ofRat_add`, hands the rational arithmetic to `norm_num`, and closes with `rfl` (which works on `≈zx` because of the `@[refl]`). It is kept behind `done`, so a goal it cannot close is handed back exactly as `grw` left it rather than half-normalised.

## Widget architecture

`zx_view_widget/src/zxDiagram.tsx` handles only the InfoView shell: the LHS/RHS side-by-side layout and its persisted toggle. For each panel it renders a `<zx-diagram>` element and assigns the Lean JSON to its `.diagram` property; zxcc lays the graph out and draws the interactive SVG. Nodes are draggable, H-boxes auto-position at the barycenter of their neighbours, and parallel edges are drawn as bezier arcs.

## Displaying diagrams in the InfoView

Diagrams reach the InfoView two ways, both defined in `SpLean/Panel.lean`:

- **`ZXPanel`** — a panel widget (`mk_rpc_widget%` over `ZXPanel.rpc`) that reads the main goal and renders a `d₁ ≈z d₂` goal as LHS and RHS side by side. Enable it per section with `show_panel_widgets [local ZXPanel]`, or per proof with `with_panel_widgets [ZXPanel]`. It tracks the cursor, so every step of a proof displays its own diagram with no tactic call.
- **`zxPresenter`** — an `@[expr_presenter]` covering both a `≈z` goal and a bare `ZXDiagram` term. ProofWidgets' `SelectionPanel` uses it to render subterms shift-clicked in the tactic state; `GoalTypePanel` uses it to render the goal type. Enable either the same way, e.g. `show_panel_widgets [local ProofWidgets.SelectionPanel]`.

Outside a proof, the `#zx d` command (also in `Panel.lean`) renders a diagram. It takes either representation — a graph-style `ZXDiagram` or an algebraic `ZX n m` — and is the replacement for ProofWidgets' `#html d.toHtml`; the project has no remaining `#html` call sites. Because `ZX n m` is arity-indexed there is no single expected type to elaborate against, so the argument is elaborated with no expected type and the result dispatched on its type: notation that needs one (`.spider .Z 1 1`, anonymous constructors) has to be ascribed, e.g. `#zx (.spider .Z 1 1 : ZX 1 1)`. Anything else fails with an error naming the term's actual type. A `ZXDiagram` still has to be closed (it is evaluated); an algebraic term does not, and one with leading `∀`s over its phases is drawn with the binder names.

`ZXPanel` and `zxPresenter` are `ZXDiagram`-only, and both evaluate the `Expr` to a real `ZXDiagram` via `evalZXDiagram` (`Meta.evalExpr`), so they need closed terms. On a goal with free variables or an unassigned metavariable LHS, `ZXPanel` shows "No ZX diagram" and `zxPresenter` throws — which is how `getExprPresentations` knows to omit it. A presenter that cannot render **must** throw rather than return empty HTML.

Tactics do not log diagrams. `zx_debug` is the one tactic that writes to the InfoView, printing `ZXDiagram.debugJson` — which, unlike `toWire`, keeps the `none` slots left by `removeNode` as `{"id": i, "type": "none"}`, since where the holes are is what you want when debugging a rewrite. That JSON is never sent to the widget; `"none"` is not a zxcc node type.

## Two ZX representations

- **`ZXDiagram`** (`SpLean/Axiomatic/ZXDiagram.lean`) — graph-style: nodes + edges. Used by all rewrite rules in `Axiomatic/Rules/*` and the `≈z` equivalence. It used to sit in the shared root because the algebraic renderer lowered into it; it no longer does, so it lives with the rules that use it.
- **`ZX n m`** (`SpLean/Algebraic/ZX.lean`) — free-algebra ADT indexed by arity, with a denotational semantics (`ZX.sem`) and a proportionality equivalence `≈zx` proved against it. Spider fusion is *proved* here rather than axiomatised, and rewritten with `zx_rw`; the two halves are still unconnected, so the rules in `Axiomatic/Rules/` do not yet benefit.

Both render through `SpLean.Wire`, by separate lowerings: `ZXDiagram.toWire` supplies no positions, so zxcc lays the graph out itself; `ZXSkel.toWire` supplies a `(col, qubit)` for every node from the algebraic structure — `compose` advances col, `stack` advances qubit; a `wire` stays a real `wire` node so the boxes around it are non-empty — so zxcc skips its layout. Each `stack`/`compose` subtree also records a bounding rectangle drawn behind the diagram. Algebraic terms are walked at the `Expr` level rather than evaluated, so a diagram parameterized by a phase (`(α : AlgPhase) → ZX 0 0`) renders with `α` written on the spider. See `SpLean/Algebraic/CLAUDE.md` for details.

## Lean tips

- `ZXDiagram` has a manual `BEq` instance that sorts edges before comparison, so edge order doesn't affect equality
